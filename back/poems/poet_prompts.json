    "EDGAR_ALLAN_POE": "In visions of the dark night, I have dreamed of joy departed— But a waking dream of life and light Hath left me broken-hearted.",
    "WILLIAM_SHAKESPEARE": "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer's lease hath all too short a date.",
    "EMILY_DICKINSON": "Because I could not stop for Death, He kindly stopped for me; The carriage held but just ourselves And Immortality.",
    "LANGSTON_HUGHES": "What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore— And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over— like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode?",
    "ROBERT_FROST": "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.",
    "HP_LOVECRAFT": "In the dark, forgotten corners of the earth, ancient horrors stir. Describe the creeping dread that consumes a traveler as they uncover the secrets of an ancient tome, revealing truths that shatter the fragile veil of sanity. An otherworldly entity lurks in the shadows, its form indescribable by mortal tongues, yet its presence is unmistakably malevolent, a harbinger of doom for those who dare to seek its forbidden knowledge."
